    <p>
    i Know a Place
    is Somwhere i go when i need to remember
    your face
    we get marrie i =n our heads
    something to do whilst we try to recall how we met
<br>
    do you think i have forgotten?
    do you think i have forgotten?
    do you think i have forgotten about you?
<br>
    you and i
    were alive
    with nothing to do i could lay and just look in your eyes
    wait and pretend
    hold on and hope that we'll find our way back in the end
<br>
    do you think i have forgotten?
    do you think i have forgotten?
    do you think i have forgotten about you?
    do you think i have forgotten?
    do you think i have forgotten?
    do you think i have forgotten? about you?
<br>
    there was something about you that now i can't rememberit's the same damn thing that made my heart surrender
    and i'll miss you on a train
    i'll miss you in the morning
    i never know what to think about, so think about you
    (i think about you)
    about you 
    do you think i have forgotten?
    about you
    about you
    do you think i have forgotten about you?
    </p>
